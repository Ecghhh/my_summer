            what i learnt
            so i learnt about different progamming language types such as html, css, javascript etc.during my holiday i
            was opportuned to focus on html and css as a bedrock for every website, web application that exist. html and
            css is the foundation for every aspiring software developer that wants to major in front end development and
            mobile development and mobile application.

            I started with HTML, the markup language used to create the basic structure of web pages. I learned about
            elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images, and how they are organized using tags. I
            practiced creating simple web pages, focusing on the correct use of semantic HTML to ensure that my code was
            clean and well-organized.

            Once I felt comfortable with HTML, I moved on to CSS, the language used for styling web pages. I learned how
            to apply different styles to HTML elements, such as changing colors, fonts, and layouts. I experimented with
            various CSS properties, including margins, padding, borders, and positioning, to create visually appealing
            designs. I also explored responsive design techniques to ensure that my web pages look good on different
            devices.

            During my holiday, I decided to spend my time productively by learning HTML and CSS, the foundational
            languages of web development. My goal was to gain a solid understanding of how websites are structured and
            styled, which I believe will be valuable for both personal and professional growth.

            By the end of my holiday, I had created several small projects, including a personal portfolio website. This
            experience has not only deepened my understanding of web development but also sparked a new interest in
            creating and designing websites.
